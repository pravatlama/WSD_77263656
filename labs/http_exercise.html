    <p class="question">
      <span>1.</span> What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      <span>Ans:</span>
      Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for
      transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      <span>2.</span>Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      <span>Ans:</span>
      HTTP is called as a stateless protocol because each request is executed
      independently, without any knowledge of the requests that were executed
      before it, which means once the transaction ends the connection between
      the browser and the server is also lost.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      <span>3.</span>
      Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server
      protocols such as HTTP
    </p>
    <p class="answer"><span>Ans:</span></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The client establishes a TCP connection (or the appropriate connection
        if the transport layer is not TCP).
      </li>
      <li>The client sends its request, and waits for the answer.</li>
      <li>
        The server processes the request, sending back its answer, providing a
        status code and appropriate data.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="question">
      <span>4.</span>Describe the parameters on a get and post request.
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      <span>Ans:</span> The GET method requests a representation of the
      specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.<br />
      The POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource,
      often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      <span>5.</span>What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP
      status codes, 200, and 404 indicate?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      <span>Ans:</span>HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific
      HTTP request has been successfully completed. The HTTP 200 OK success
      status response code indicates that the request has succeeded. The HTTP
      404 Not Found client error response code indicates that the server can't
      find the requested resource.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      <span>6.</span>What are HTTP cookies? Give an example.
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      <span>Ans:</span>An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small
      piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser. For example,
      a web server might send a cookie containing the username that was last
      used to log into a website, so that it may be filled in automatically the
      next time the user logs in.
    </p>
    <p class="question"><span>7.</span>Why are cookies a security issue?</p>
    <p class="answer">
      <span>Ans:</span>It can be read and modified by someone with access to the
      client's hard disk (or JavaScript if the HttpOnly attribute is not set).
    </p>
    <p class="question"><span>8.</span>Describe session hijacking and XSS</p>
    <p class="answer">
      <span>Ans:</span>Session hijacking consists of gaining access to and
      misusing a user's authenticated session. This may happen by stealing a
      cookie for an existing session, or by fooling the user (or their browser)
      into setting a cookie with a predetermined session ID. <br />
      Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security exploit which allows an attacker
      to inject into a website malicious client-side code. This code is executed
      by the victims and lets the attackers bypass access controls and
      impersonate users.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      <span>9.</span>Describe Cross-site request forgery(CSRF)
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      <span>Ans:</span>
      CSRF (sometimes also called XSRF) is a related class of attack. The
      attacker causes the user's browser to perform a request to the website's
      backend without the user's consent or knowledge. An attacker can use an
      XSS payload to launch a CSRF attack.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      <span>10.</span>What are Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests
      use CORS?
    </p>
    <p class="answer"><span>Ans:</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Invocations of the XMLHttpRequest or Fetch APIs</li>
      <li>
        Web Fonts (for cross-domain font usage in @font-face within CSS), so
        that servers can deploy TrueType fonts that can only be cross-site
        loaded and used by web sites that are permitted to do so.
      </li>
      <li>WebGL textures.</li>
      <li>Images/video frames drawn to a canvas using drawImage().</li>
      <li>CSS Shapes from images.</li>
    </ul>
